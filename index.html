          <p>Peter Zezima, better known as just Zezima, is a cyberworld celebrity who was the highest ranked player in the game "Runescape" overall. He started playing back in 2001 and has continued to participate in the game ever since. Some of his more
            important achievements include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>First player to achieve level 99 Slayer</li>
            <li>A total level of 1980 and then 2079</li>
            <li>One BILLION experience overall</li>
            <li> 200 million experience in all skills also known as the experience cap for any particular skill</li>
          </ul>
          <p>It is fair to say that Peter Zezima is one of the most famous players in the game equally recognized Jagex mods and players alike. To achieve what he has done requires enormous time, dedication, and incredible knowledge, especially during the
            infant stanges of Runescape. He is surely a pilar of the game's history. I'm sure we all remember adding Zezima to our friends list and spamming him with messages upon turning on public chat!</p>

          <p>The community he is world-renowned for is from Runescape, a browser based MMORPG operated by Jagex Ltd. It has been a wildly popular game going through numerous changes and constant development since 1999. Generally, nowadays people either remember
            Runescape from their childhood or see Runescape memes posted online. <a href="http://www.runescape.com/" target="_blank"><b>Click here for more information about Runescape</b></a></p>

          <p>Some of those not familiar with the Runescape community might say, "What's the big deal? He just put a lot of time into a some retro game." I'd argue he did much more than that. </p>
          <p>Many of us who played Runescape did so during our childhoods and it was a huge part of them. Back then, when it came to celebrities, I was more starstruck by Zezima than anybody else in the world. He was considered a legend by us adolescent
            players and Jagex workers alike.</p>
          <p>Although his glory days were during the mid-2000s, he is still a high ranking player and a core symbol of Runescape, appearing in memes and other forms of media. </p>
